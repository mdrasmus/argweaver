<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
The ARGweaver software package contains programs and libraries for
sampling and manipulating ancestral recombination graphs (ARGs). An ARG
is a rich data structure for representing the ancestry of DNA
sequences undergoing coalescence and recombination. From the ARG, several
different statistics of interest can be estimated such local trees,
time to most recent ancestor (TMRCA), local effective population size,
recombination rates, etc.
</p>

<p>
ARGweaver's particular strength is the ability to sample ARGs for
large genomic regions (many megabases). This is achieved by using a
discretized version of the sequentially Markov coalescent (DSMC) to model
the evolutionary history of DNA sequences. This model lends itself to
efficient computational methods. In particular, ARGweaver implements a novel
technique of efficiently sampling the ancestry of one sequence given the
ancestry of <tt>n-1</tt> sequences, an operation we call "threading" and ARG.
This is a basic building block of a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling
method which we have implemented in ARGweaver (see
<a href="#sec-prog-arg-sample"><tt>arg-sample</tt></a>). Using the
posterior samples the ARG, we have implemented several methods for
extracting statistics of interest
<a href="#sec-prog-arg-extract-tmrca"><tt>arg-extract-tmrca</tt></a>,
<a href="#sec-prog-arg-extract-popsize"><tt>arg-extract-popsize</tt></a>,
etc.
</p>


<a name="sec-prog"></a>
<h2>Programs</h2>

<p>
ARGweaver contains several programs for simulating, inferring, and manipulating
ARGs, which are located in the <tt>bin/</tt> directory. The main usage
and description of each program can be found by using the <tt>--help</tt>
option for each program.
</p>

<a name="sec-prog-arg-sample"></a>
<h3>arg-sample</h3>

<p>
<tt>arg-sample</tt> is the main program for inferring ancestral
recombination graphs (ARGs). It takes DNA sequences specified in
a file format called <a href="#sec-file-sites"><tt>*.sites</tt></a> and
samples ARGs the posterior distribution, which are stored in a
file format called <a href="#sec-file-smc"><tt>*.smc</tt></a>.
</p>

<h4>Main arguments</h4>

<div class="code">
  -s,--sites  &lt;sites alignment&gt; <br>
  -f,--fasta  &lt;fasta alignment&gt;
</div>

<p>
Input DNA sequence alignments can be specified in either the
<a href="#sec-file-sites"><tt>*.sites</tt></a> or
<a href="#sec-file-fasta"><tt>FASTA</tt></a> file formats.
The files can also be <tt>gzip</tt> compressed if the <tt>*.gz</tt>
file extension is present.
</p>

<div class="code">
  -o,--output  &lt;output prefix&gt;
</div>

<p>
This specifies a prefix for all output filenames
(default <tt>'arg-sample'</tt>). It is usually most convenient to specify
a new directory since many output files can be generated (i.e. each
ARG sample). If any of the directories in the output path do not exist,
<tt>arg-sample</tt> will create them.
</p>

<div class="code">
  -a,--arg  &lt;SMC file&gt;
</div>

<p>
This optional argument specifies an initial ARG (stored in
<a href="#sec-file-smc"><tt>*.smc</tt></a> format) for sampling.
This is useful for resuming a previous sampling. If the ARG does not
contain all of the sequences present in the input sequence alignment file,
the missing sequences will first be added using the "threading" procedure.
Once a complete ARG is obtained, normal sampling will continue.
This feature allows one to easily build a "core ARG" of a small number of
sequences and then add in additional sequences in a separate run.
</p>

<div class="code">
  --region  &lt;start&gt;-&lt;end&gt;
</div>

<p>
This optional argument specifies that an ARG should only be sampled
for a subregion (<tt>start-end</tt>) of the sites.
</p>

<div class="code">
  --maskmap  &lt;sites mask&gt;
</div>

<p>
This specifies that certain regions should be masked out sites from the
alignment.  Regions should be specified in a three column
<a href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat.html#format1">BED file</a>.
</p>


<h4>Model parameters</h4>

<p><tt>arg-sample</tt> assumes a prior model for the evolution of
the input DNA sequences. The parameters of the prior model can be specified
with the following arguments.
</p>

<div class="code">
  -N,--popsize  &lt;population size&gt;
</div>

<p>
This specifies the effective population size (default 10,000).
<tt>arg-sample</tt> assumes the population is diploid.
<p>

<div class="code">
  -m,--mutrate  &lt;mutation rate&gt;
</div>

<p>
This specifies a constant mutation rate as mutations per site per generation
(default 2.5e-8). To specify a varying mutation rate see <tt>--mutmap</tt>.
</p>

<div class="code">
  -r,--recombrate  &lt;recombination rate&gt;
</div>

<p>
This specifies a constant recombination rate in recombinations per site per
generation (default 1.5e-8). To specify a varying recombination rate
see <tt>--recombmap</tt>.
</p>

<div class="code">
  -t,--ntimes  &lt;ntimes&gt; <br>
  --maxtime  &lt;maxtime&gt; <br>
  --time-step  &lt;time&gt; <br>
  --times-file  &lt;times filename&gt;
</div>

<p>
ARGweaver approximates the evolutionary process as occurring in
discretized time steps. These options provide several ways of specify
the time steps. The most common setting is to allow time steps to be spaced
logarithmically (finer resolution in recent times and coarser resolution
in older times). This can be done by specifying the number of time steps
<tt>--ntimes</tt> and a maximum time <tt>--maxtime</tt>. Time is always
expressed in number of generations ago, where 0 is the present day.
Time steps can also be specified to be spaced linearly with a step size
<tt>--time-step</tt>, or they can be specified explicitly in a
file <tt>--times-file</tt> one per line.
</p>

<div class="code">
  -M,--mutmap  &lt;mutation rate map file&gt;
  -R,--recombmap  &lt;recombination rate map file&gt;
</div>

<p>
These options allow varying mutation rates and recombination rates to be
specified. The files should be in <a href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat.html#format1.8">bedGraph format.</a>
</p>

<h4>Sampling</h4>

<p>
<tt>arg-sample</tt> produces posterior samples of the ARG using
Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). These options customize the sampling
process.
</p>

<div class="code">
  -n,--iters  &lt;# of iterations&gt;
</div>

<p>
This specifies the total number of sample iterations (default 1000).
</p>

<div class="code">
  --resample-region  &lt;start&gt;-&lt;end&gt;
</div>

<p>
This optional argument specifies a subregion to resample of input ARG
</p>

<div class="code">
  --resume
</div>

<p>
This option allows a previous sampling to be resumed if it was interrupted
or if more iterations are desired.  Sampling options can be changed from
previous run.
</p>

<div class="code">
  --overwrite
</div>

<p>
By default, <tt>arg-sample</tt> does not overwrite files that already exist,
thus protecting against accidental loss of data. Use this
option, if overwriting is intended.
</p>


<h4>Miscellaneous</h4>

<div class="code">
  -c,--compress-seq  &lt;compression factor&gt;
</div>

<p>
To speed up the algorithm, the sequence alignment can be
compressed during sampling into blocks such 10bp or 20bp.
Recombinations are only allowed between blocks but within.
By default the compression is 1bp per block.
</p>

<div class="code">
  --sample-step  &lt;sample step size&gt;
</div>

<p>
This specifies how often to write ARG samples to file.
By default, the ARG is written every 10 iterations.
</p>

<div class="code">
  --no-compress-output
</div>

<p>
Do not use <tt>gzip</tt> to compress output.
</p>

<div class="code">
  -x,--randseed  &lt;random seed&gt;
</div>

<p>
<tt>arg-sample</tt> uses a random number generator in the sampling process.
This option specifies the seed (default is based on current time).
Using the same seed as a previous run will reproduce the run.
</p>


<h4>Information</h4>

<div class="code">
  -V,--verbose  &lt;verbosity level&gt;
</div>

<p>
Set the level of logging verbosity (0=quiet, 1=low, 2=medium, 3=high)
</p>

<div class="code">
  -q,--quiet
</div>

<p>
Completely suppress logging to standard error (stderr).
</p>

<div class="code">
  -v,--version <br>
  -h,--help <br>
  --help-advanced
</div>

<p>
These options display version and help information.  <tt>--help-advanced</tt>
displays additional options that are experimental or are useful for
debugging purposes.
</p>


<a name="sec-file"></a>
<h2>File formats</h2>

<p>
ARGweaver uses several different file formats for sequence alignments and 
represent ancestral recombination graphs (ARGs) which are described here. 
Since some of these files can be quite large, they can be compressed using
<tt>gzip</tt>. All programs in ARGweaver can automatically detect
if a file is compressed if the filename ends with <tt>*.gz</tt>.
</p>


<a name="sec-file-fasta"></a>
<h3>FASTA file format (*.fa)</h3>

<p>
ARGweaver can use the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTA_format">
FASTA file format</a> for sequences
alignments.  The file extension is not important and many different 
extensions are in common use (*.fa, *.mfa, *.fasta, *.align).
</p>

<p>
Each line starting with "&gt;" indicates a sequence (haplotype) name.  
This assumes sequences are phased and that each individual contributes
two such sequences. Note, the entire line after
the "&gt;" is used as the sequence name.  The sequence is given on
the following lines and it may be wrapped to any number of columns (or
not wrapped at all).  Unknown characters in the alignment are represented 
with the "N" character.
</p>

<a name="figure-fasta"></a>
<div class="figure">

<div class="code">
<pre>
&gt;individual1_haplotype1
ATACGCGCTCGCCCATAGCTTCCTCAAACCATTCTACTACGACCCTGTATGTTTACCGAGTG

</pre>
</div>

<div class="figcaption">
<span class="figtitle">Figure: Example FASTA *.fa file.</span> Each 
haplotype sequence is fully specified. Sequence names can be given in
any format.  Sequences are all assumed to be randomly sampled from the
population and no assumptions are made about how they relate to individuals.
In practice, each individual contribute two sequences, but the ARGweaver
software does not make use of such information.
</div>
</div>


<a name="sec-file-sites"></a>
<h3>Sites file format (*.sites, *.sites.gz)</h3>

<p>
Since in most populations the mutation rate can be quite low, more sites
in an alignment will be invariant.  FASTA is a very inefficient
file format for such sequences.  Instead it is often more convenient to 
use the <tt>*.sites</tt> file format which only specifies the variant
sites in an alignment. Sites not specified are assumed to be invariant.
See <a href="../examples/sim1/sim1.sites">sim1.sites</a> for an example.
</p>

<p>
The sites format is tab-delimited. It currently has two header lines
which are distinguished by the first column.
</p>

<ul>
  <li><tt>NAMES</tt>: this line indicates the names of the sequences in the
    following columns. Names can have any format provided they do not 
    contain tab or newline characters.</li>
  <li><tt>REGION</tt>: this line indicates what genomic region is represented
    in the file. The following columns are <tt>CHROMOSOME</tt>, 
    <tt>START</tt>, <tt>END</tt>.
    <tt>CHROMSOME</tt> is a chomosome name, while <tt>START</tt> and 
    <tt>END</tt> indicate the region using 1-based and end-inclusive
    coordinates.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The remaining lines specify the variant positions in the sequence alignment.
The first column gives the 1-based coordinate of the variant position and the
second column gives the bases for each sequence at that position. Bases
are given in the same order as the sequence names in the <tt>NAMES</tt> line.
The sites are required to be sorted by their position.
</p>

<a name="sec-file-smc"></a>
<h3>Sequentially Markov coalescent SMC file format (*.smc, *.smc.gz)</h3>

<p>
ARGweaver uses the Sequentially Markov coalescent SMC model as an
approximation of the evolutionary process.  This approximation also
imposes are restriction on the structure of the ARG.  Namely the ARG
can be represented as a series of local (also known as marginal) trees
interspersed with subtree pruning and regrafting (SPR) operations that
describe how two neighboring local trees differ from one another.
Each SPR corresponds to a recombination event in the evolutionary past
of the sequences.  However, not all recombination events are
expressible as SPR operations, specifically recombinations that occur
in non-ancestral sequences.  The SMC file format explicitly stores
each of these local trees and the SPR operations between
them. Although this is more verbose than storing the ARG as a directed
acyclic graph (DAG, see
<a href="#sec-file-arg">*.arg</a>) it is often more convenient since
extracting local trees and their statistics is one of the most common
operations to perform on ARGs.
</p>

<p>
The SMC format is tab-delimited. It currently has two header lines
which are distinguished by the first column.
</p>

<ul>
  <li><tt>NAMES</tt>: this line indicates the names of the sequences in the
    following columns. Names can have any format provided they do not 
    contain tab or newline characters.</li>
  <li><tt>REGION</tt>: this line indicates what genomic region is represented
    in the file. The following columns are <tt>CHROMOSOME</tt>, 
    <tt>START</tt>, <tt>END</tt>.
    <tt>CHROMSOME</tt> is a chomosome name, while <tt>START</tt> and 
    <tt>END</tt> indicate the region using 1-based and end-inclusive
    coordinates.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The remaining lines specify the local trees and SPR operations. The
type of line is indicated by the first column and have the following formats:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><tt>TREE start end tree</tt>: this line indicates a local tree
    that exists from coordinates <tt>start</tt> to <tt>end</tt> (1-index,
    end-inclusive). <tt>tree</tt> is the local tree represented in 
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newick_format">newick format</a>.
    Every node in the tree is numbered. The leaves are numbered between 0 and
    <tt>n-1</tt>, where <tt>n</tt> is the total number of sequences. The
    numbering is given in the same ordering as the sequence names in the
    <tt>NAMES</tt> line.  Branch lengths are given in units of generations.
    NHX style comments are used to also indicate the age of every node.
    Although this is redundant given branch lengths, these comments ensure
    ages are preserved perfectly since adding branch lengths to determine
    age is susceptible to rounding errors.</li>
  <li><tt>SPR position recomb_node recomb_time coal_node coal_time</tt>:
    this line specifies the subtree pruning and regrafting (SPR) operation
    responsible for changing the previous local tree into the next 
    local tree. <tt>position</tt> is the last base in the previous local
    block before the recombination event. <tt>recomb_node</tt> gives the
    branch number in the previous local tree that bares the recombination
    event and <tt>recomb_time</tt> gives the time in generations of the 
    recombination. <tt>coal_node</tt> gives the branch name in previous local
    tree of where the broken branch re-coalesces and <tt>coal_time</tt>
    gives the re-coalescence time in generations.</li>
</ul>
